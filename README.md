# Ceasar-cipher
A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique, shifting letters by a fixed number of positions.
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters in the text by a specific number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D
B becomes E
Z becomes C (wraps around)
# ðŸš€ Features
Encryption: Converts plaintext into ciphertext.
Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext.
Custom Shifts: Set custom shift values.
User Input: Interactive CLI-based text input.
# Example
Enter the message: HELLO
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: KHOOR

Enter the message: KHOOR
Enter the shift value: 3
Decrypted message: HELLO
